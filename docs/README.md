This is the internal back-end service for the SIM ILC project, providing a robust API for managing users, programs, enrollments, payments, certificates, dicussions, and feedbacks. It's built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize.

For a fully containerized setup using Docker, please see the [**Docker Setup Guide**](README.Docker.md).

Features
--------

This project is designed to be a comprehensive management system for a learning center.

*   **User Authentication & Management**: Secure user registration, login (with JWT), password reset, and profile management.

*   **Program & Module Management**: Create, read, update, and delete learning programs (Courses, Seminars, Workshops) and their associated modules.
    
*   **Enrollment & Progress Tracking**: Allow users to enroll in programs and track their progress by marking modules as complete.
    
*   **Certificate Generation**: Automatically issue certificates to users upon completion of a program.
    
*   **Invoicing & Payments**: Generate invoices for paid programs and handle payment verification.
    
*   **Discussion Forums**: A complete forum system where users can post comments, reply to others, and like comments.

*   **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates between regular `User` and `Admin` roles, ensuring secure access to administrative endpoints.
    
*   **Secure File Uploads**: Supports profile photo uploads with type validation and image compression, storing files in an S3-compatible service.
    
*   **Containerized Environment**: Full support for Docker and Docker Compose, allowing for a consistent and reproducible development and production environment.
    

Getting Started: Local Development
----------------------------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes without using Docker.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

*   **Node.js**: v22.19.0 or higher
    
*   **npm**: v10.8.1 or higher
    
*   **Git**
    
*   **PostgreSQL**: A running instance of PostgreSQL.
    
*   **Redis**: A running instance of Redis.
    
*   **MinIO**: A running instance of MinIO or another S3-compatible object storage service.
    

### 1\. Clone & Install Dependencies

First, clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary npm packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bibbeep/Sistem-Informasi-Manajemen-Informatics-Learning-Center-Back-End.git
cd Sistem-Informasi-Manajemen-Informatics-Learning-Center-Back-End
npm install
```
    
    

### 2\. Configure Environment Variables

The application requires several environment variables to run correctly.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
    
3.  Fill in the values for each variable as described below.

### 3\. Set Up the Database

After configuring your `.env` file with your database credentials, you need to create the database and run the migrations.

```bash
# Create the database defined in your .env file
npx sequelize-cli db:create

# Run all pending migrations to create the tables
npm run db:migrate
```
    
    

### 4\. Run the Application

You can now start the application in development mode. This will use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when you make changes to the code.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
    
    

The server will be running at [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) (or the port you specified in `.env`).

Running Tests
-------------

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.

*   **Run all tests:**

    ```bash
    npm run test

    # or the silent version
    npm run -s test:clean
    ```
        
        
    
*   **Run only unit tests:**
    
    ```bash
    npm run test:unit
    ```
        
    
*   **Run only integration tests:**
    
    ```bash
    npm run test:integration

    # or the silent version
    npm run -s test:integration:clean
    ```
